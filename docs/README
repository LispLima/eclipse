For complete instructions on how to use Eclipse, please read the
manual.  This file contains only intallation instructions and some
other general information. 
Eclipse comes without ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. See the COPYING file for
details.

I would love to receive feedback/coments/idea/bugreports, so feel free
to send me any comments you might have.

Finally, I only compiled and tested Eclipse with CMUCL.  It should
work for other ANSI CL implementations, but the Makefile may have to
be modified, I guess. 
(I have test it under x86 and Sparc ultra 1 with solaris).



Requirements :
--------------

In order to use Eclipse, you need the following to work on your
machine :
 - Common Lisp (see the www.cons.org/cmucl for a free implementation)
 - Loop (it usually comes with the standard, at least for CMUCL and ACL)
 - CLX library (AINSI CL implementation of the Xlib)
 - MK-Defsystem library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/clocc/)
 - GNOME (optional)

You can find all the Lisp parts in the Debian packages
(http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages), I recommand to use them.

 - A core image of the language that includes CLX and defsystem (and
   loop if needed). See the core creation section for more information.



Install :
---------

shell $ ./configure
shell $ make
shell $ make install

should work. (at least for CMUCL)

see ./configure --help for options that can be used.
the particular --enable and --with options recognized:

  --with-lisp=DIR or FILE         your lisp system.
  --with-core=FILE                specifies particular core image to use if
				  the default one is not appropriate.
  --enable-compile-into-core=FILE core image name for compile destination
				  default is disable.
				  default core name : eclipse-lisp.core.
  --with-gnome-entry-dir=PATH     path to the wm-properties directory.
				  default is enable.
				  (default search list :
					 /usr/share/gnome/wm-properties
					 /usr/local/share/gnome/wm-properties )


Core creation :
---------------

Here is an example of this operation for CMUCL:

done.]

Process inferior-lisp finished

Now create a symlink in your standard cmucl directory from your custom
image to lisp.core to start lisp with the new image by default.
Otherwise use the CMUCL shell option -core. (see CMUCL manual for
complete information).
