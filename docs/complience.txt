 1) Introduction
  ---------------
 This document is a work in progress and is in no way complete or
 accurate ! Its purpose is to details eclipse compliance with the
 relevent standards. The format of this document is as follows: 
 
 [-/+?] Hint Name/Feature Name (Version number)
        Errata/Comments
 
 The first character indicates the level of compliance as follows:
    -   none
    /   partial
    +   complete
    ?   unknown
 
 The title indicates a feature or a hint in the specification, and the
 version number indicates the minimum version of the specification
 supported by eclipse.  Later versions may be supported if no
 incompatible changes have been made in the specification.
  
 2) EWMH Compliance
 ------------------
  
 The EWMH, or Extended Window Manager Hints is a freedesktop.org-
 developed standard to support a number of conventions for
 communication between the window manager and clients.  It builds on
 and extends the ICCCM (See Section 3).  A copy of the current EWMH
 standard is available at http://freedesktop.org/Standards/wm-spec/
 
   a. Root Window Properties (and Related Messages)
   ------------------------------------------------

 + _NET_SUPPORTED (1.3)
 
 + _NET_CLIENT_LIST (1.3)
 
 + _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS (1.3)
 
 / _NET_DESKTOP_GEOMETRY (-)
   Eclipse does not implement large desktops. Regardless, according
   to the specification, eclipse set this property to the screen size,
   and SHOULD update it if the screen size changes because of a RandR
   change.

 - _NET_DESKTOP_VIEWPORT (-)
   Eclipse does not implement viewports.  However, according to the
   specification, eclipse set this property to (0,0)*
 
 + _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP (1.3)

 + _NET_DESKTOP_NAMES (1.3)

 + _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW (1.3)

 + _NET_WORKAREA (1.3)

 + _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK (1.3)
 
 + _NET_VIRTUAL_ROOTS (1.3)
   Eclipse does not read or set this property, but it does not use
   virtual roots to implement virtual desktops, so it complies with the
   specification.
 
 - _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT (1.3)
   Eclipse does not read or set this property.
 
 - _NET_SHOWING_DESKTOP (1.3)
 
   b. Other Root Window Messages
   -----------------------------
 
 + _NET_CLOSE_WINDOW (1.3)
 
 + _NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW (-)
 
 - _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE (1.3)

  c. Application Window Properties
  --------------------------------
 
 + _NET_WM_NAME (1.3)
 
 + _NET_WM_VISIBLE_NAME (1.3)
   Eclipse does not set this property, but eclipse will never display
   a name different from _NET_WM_NAME
 
 + _NET_WM_ICON_NAME (1.3)

 + _NET_WM_VISIBLE_ICON_NAME (1.3)
   Eclipse does not set this property, but eclipse will never display
   a name different from _NET_WM_VISIBLE_ICON_NAME.
 
 + _NET_WM_DESKTOP (1.3)
 
 + _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE (1.3)
 
 + _NET_WM_STATE (1.3)
 
 - _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS (1.3)
   Eclipse does not set or read this property. Regardless, according
   to the specification, eclipse SHOULD set it.
 
 + _NET_WM_STRUT (1.3)
 
 + _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL (1.3)
 
 - _NET_WM_ICON_GEOMETRY (1.3)
   Eclipse does not uses this property to draw minimize/restore
   animations.
 
 + _NET_WM_ICON (1.3)
 
 - _NET_WM_PID (1.3)
   Eclipse does not uses this property. Eclipse would need a generic
   unix-kill that is not present in the C.L Hyperspec so it has to be
   system dependent. Should not be hard to do; just hasn't been done.
 
 + _NET_WM_HANDLED_ICONS (1.3)
 
 - _NET_WM_USER_TIME (-)
   Eclipse does not read or set this property.  The EWMH does not
   require it to do so, but it should support it.
 
  d. Window Manager Protocols
  ---------------------------
 - _NET_WM_PING (1.3)
