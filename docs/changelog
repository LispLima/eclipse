0.01 => 0.02

     Eclipse should now compile on every ANSI-compliant Common Lisp
     implementation.  This release actually looks quite usable.

     - sticky corrected.
     - window cycling corrected.
     - focus management is ICCCM complient. (thanks to Matthias Clasen)
     - pointer freezing corrections.
     - unexpected events during resize corrected.
     - unexpected events during move partially corrected.
     
     - gnome extended wm spec implemented and support added.
     - workspace names added.
     - button behavior changed : they are now "push buttons".
     - iconified windows now appears in the running menu like this: [ emacs ]
     - added some forgotten WITH-STANDARD-IO-SYNTAX. (thanks to Eric Marsden)
     - a mouse click in an application now puts it on top.
     - users can now define their own keystrokes. (see the man section)

     - complete change of keyboard handling. It works now without the 
       cmucl-hemlocks part. (thanks to Gilbert Bauman)
     - complete change of error-handling. (should work better)
     
     - some change in the autoconf script. Should now work correctly.
     - corrections in some parts of man and README.
       
0.02 => pre 0.03 (for James A. CRIPPEN)

     - bugs correction.
     - some change on sticky. should be 100% correct.
     - added X cursors.
     - added more Extended WM Spec complience.
     - update the gnome-manager.lisp (according to draft 1.2)
       - added utf8<->string converters (maybe not 100% correct)
       - all property that were suppose to be of type utf8 now are.
     - change "second button" menu behavior concerning the sticky window.
	They now apear in it.
     - change the way to add or remove desktop:
	now use (setf (number-of-virtual-screens) a-number)
     - added a new file virtual-screen.lisp which contain a sort of 
	generic implementation of the virtual-screen, and wm.lisp 
	now contain a specialisation of this class, named:
	eclipse-screens.
     - added two more predifined keystrokes for simulating the mouse buttons
        four and five (the wheel).
     - added some #. reader for avoiding some consing in some defconstant.

pre 0.03=>0.03

     - grid undraw failure during move in box type is now fixed.
     - added coordinates display during move and resize.
     - added opaque resize mode.
     - new theme interface (needs to be documented).
     - some new themes have been added (CoolClean, brushed-metal, Step).

0.03=>0.04

     - created an eclipse-internals package.
     - some bugs fix.
     - some functionalities added.
     - file splitting to reorganize the project a little:
     - wm.lisp and global.lisp had been splitted into:
	- widgets.lisp (base-widget, root, application, buttons, ...)
	- input.lisp (general event processing)
	- gestures.lisp (key-combo, cursor movement)
	- eclipse.lisp (Top level functions)
	- move-resize (moving and resizing master)
	- misc.lisp (...)
	- lib/clx-ext/clx-extensions.lisp
     - gnome-manager.lisp had been splitted into:
	- manager-commons.lisp
	- gnome-manager.lisp
	- netwm-manager.lisp
	- one directory added with one sub-directory: lib and lib/clx-ext
	- a new package clx-extensions in lib/clx-ext
	- some files had moved:
	  - image-reader.lisp into lib
	  - event.lisp ...... into lib/clx-ext
	  - cursor.lisp ..... ----------------
	  - cursordef.lisp .. ----------------
	  - keysysms.lisp ... ----------------
	  - keysymdef.lisp .. ----------------

     - commit Christian Lynbech patch:
       CMUCL seems to have tighten the handling of certain things so this
       patch will do three necessary things:

       - in system.lisp (compile-theme) remove path from :output-file name as
         this includes path specs from the input file.

       - in wm.lisp (menu-3-prcess) removes the &allow-other-keys which CMUCL
         18d chokes on (some previous versions seemed more lax, they also
	 accepted (lambda (&rest) ...) which 18d does not but you have gotten
	 rid of that).

      - in lib/image-reader.lisp (load-ppm) changes function to use two
        streams as there are many things you cannot do on a non-character
	string including calling `unread-char'.
	
0.04=>0.05

     - various bug fix. (with-state missing, undecore-application, some
       unhandle events during menu-3 loop, ...)
     - procede-decoration code is inside an unwind-protect.
     - support for focus-new-mapped-window
     - support for :_net_wm_state_maximized_{horz/vert},
       and :_net_wm_state_fullscreen.
     - fix typo parenthesis, and grid undraw in mouse stroke resize/move.
     - more netwm complience improvement (fullscreen, hidden, 
       icon-name, maximized)
     - Christian Lynbech patch for icon managment has been applied.
       "It provides an icon box, ie. a configurable place where icons are
        stacked. As part of this change, I have changed the default location
	of icons from (750,50) to (0,0). If the icon box overflows, icons will
	be created ayt (0,0). I have also decreased the default height from 60
	to 20 to minimize the space waste (if the application supplies an
	icon, it will of course take precedence).

	The patch allso adds different kinds of sorting options. Icons can be
	sorted by creation time (I have added a new slot in the `icon' class)
	or name or class (or whatever else you can think of).

	It still needs a few things, such as the possibility of disabling the
	icon box and other fill orders than :top-right (ie. filling from the
	top right corner of the box)."
     
     - Unrelated to the icon box thing, the patch also contains a set of
       application inspection function (see the end of "misc.lisp"), A
       disabling of the expression that removes the "Exit" entry in the root
       menu so that you can close Eclipse down and finally a new option,
       *close-display-p*, that regulates whether exiting Eclipse also kills
       the entire X session (if *close-display-p* is nil, Eclipse will just
       exit).
     
     - ICCCM complience and extended window manager specification complience.
       - bugs fix relative to extended wm spec (i.e.: we now should interact
         correctly with gnome 2.2)
       - added ICCCM session managment complience: we now use/react to the
         owning of the WM_S{screen number} selection. see ICCCM 2.8

0.05=>0.06

     - The package now exports almost every symbols. They are sorted in
       alphabetical order and type order (class, generic function,
       function, ...)

     - An application that does not support to be maximized in fullscreen
       don't have the _net_wm_state_fullscreentom present in its
       _net_wm_state property anymore.

     - lib/clx-patch.lisp: fixed bug found in input-focus.

     - few new methods:
       dispatch-repaint: new method for the repaint protocol.
       repaint: the main method of the repaint protocol.
       (draw-focused-decoration & draw-unfocused-decoration: removed.)

     - themes are now defined in their own packages.
       All theme are updated.

0.06=>0.07

     - shade is now implemented (wm.lisp).
       To {un}shade a window double click on title bar.

     - *double-click-speed* for user configuration.
       use it to customize the time you want for double click.
       Default value: 200 (timestamp unit of the X server)

     - added support for the xvidmode extension
       (lib/clx-ext/xvidmode.lisp).

     - added support for :net_wm_state_{below, above}

     - various changes in window stacking order manipulation.
       (see put-on-top, and put-on-bottom)
     
     - buttons are now able to display a pixmap that shows its state (e.g: 
       pressed or not).
	
     - added support for _net_active_window message

     - various  bug fix and improvements:

       - typo fix *wRAp-pointer-when-cycle* => *wARp-pointer-when-cycle*
                   full-screen-mode => fullscreen-mode

       - changing the focus now cares of the map state of the window it
	 is supose to gives the focus to. (Should avoid lots of match-error).
         Wrong nil timestamp has been fixed.

       - fullscreen-mode should now be correct: the spec say it would be
         better to undecore the window when in fullscreen. It does now.

       - maximize-window signature changes. It now expect an application 
	 instead of a decoration.  
	 => STROKES USING MAXIMIZE-WINDOW SHOULD BE UPDATED.

       - minor changes in update-edges-geometry, and move-resize.lisp.

       - virtual-screen.lisp re-implementation. It now use the X server
         data such the root window tree, and window property that hold the
	 desktop number instead of an internal substructure that has to be
	 updated each time you destroy, un/iconify, shade, unshade, etc.

       - fix incorect placement of the menu button when the title bar is
	 vertical.

       - fix handling of message of type :_WIN_WORKSPACE :_NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP.
       
       - fix the _net_active_window property handling for undecorated windows.

       - fix missplaced handling for message of type _net_close_window.

       - some code clean up (removed some unused code).

     - lots of documentations added almost every where.

0.07=>0.08

     - Window rotation (Alt-Tab) re-designed. It now works as in almost
       every window managers. Press Alt-Tab once will raise the next
       application, on the current desktop, according to the current
       stacking order. If Alt is released then pressing again Alt-Tab will
       put back the precedent application. Otherwise if you kipped Alt down
       then Tab again and the next application will be brought on top of the
       others, and the precedent one is back on its depth. And so on
       until you come back on the first one. 
       The same mechanism is available with say Alt-a. It just rotate
       windows on the other sens.

     - The window rotation may be verbose by displaying a small window
       indicating the name and the icon, if provided, of the application
       that comes on top of the others.
       To disable it do (setf *verbose-window-cycling* nil) in your eclipse
       config file.

     - The window rotation may also cycle the current desktop iconified
       applications. To disable it do (setf *cycle-icons-p* nil) in
       your eclipse config file.

     - Screen edges are now resistant. 

     - fix menu bug. They don't anymore appear below their applications.

     - a maximized window does not allow anymore to be resized in the
       directions in which it has been maximized.

     - the message-box may now display a centered pixmap before the text.

0.08 => 0.09

     - The window edges resistance is also implemented.
       To configure it use *standard-window-edge-resistant-p*.
       Set it to nil if you don't want to feel any resistance on
       edges of window(s) you are about to overlap. Default value is t.

     - minor focus change:
       For application with a :no-input as focus model, we now gives the
       same event mask as the others. The problem was that an application
       with a globaly-active model can decide to sets the focus to one of
       its satellite window that have a no-input model. This is correct
       because the input model is indicate to the window manager how to
       give the focus to the application. But in any case, it indicates
       that the application will never have or not the focus.

	- give-focus-to-next-widget-in-desktop will now gives the focus to
	  the first application that claims for the focus if one, or to the
	  first one that could receive it (from top most to bottom stack
	  order). 
	- change-vscreen invoke give-focus-to-next-widget-in-desktop if
	  the focus policy is on-click.       

     - minor change in (setf fullscreen-mode): we now use the
       no-decoration-theme instead of undecorting. This will avoid
       problems in xinerama mode.

     - compile-theme hacking. Should fix theme compiling problem report by
       Robert Strandh. 

     - Fix incorect handling of the states _net_wm_state_{above, below}.
       They are permanent as the other states (see inpout.lisp).
       It implies that the (setf window-priority) should take those state
       in account when modifying the stack order (see misc.lisp) 

       This have as last implication, that we should work with an external
       list of window for the window circulation keystrokes. Indeed, if
       one window has the _net_wm_state_above state then it will always be 
       on top of the others. What means, that will stay stuck on this
       window during circulation. (see minor signature modification of
       circulate-window in virtual-screen.lisp, and small hack in
       gestures.lisp) 

     - new file rectangles.lisp. This module computes a list of the
       largest free rectangles available on a virtual screen. This will
       gives us some new maximize mode such as maximize a window to fit
       the largest rectangle that includes it, without creating more
       overlaps than already exists.

     - maximize-window modified to use the maximize-fill operation.

     - new user configuration options: *maximize-fill* *maximize-modifier*
       (setf maximize-modifier) function. It allow user to choose a
       modifier key that will alter the maximize button behavior if the
       choosen modifier down or not when pressing on maximize button. If
       modifier is down then the value of (not *maximize-fill*) will be
       used otherwise *maximize-fill* will be used. 

     - We now support the netwm-strut{-partial}, and don't overlap panels
       that should not be overlapped (gnome panels for exemple) 

 0.09 => 0.10

     - fix the problem raised by Christian. Icons have the following
       behavior: 
        - when you click on an icon it comes on top of anything else.
	- when you release the mouse button after a move (otherwise the
	  application get de-iconified) the icon window priority goes back
	  at the bottom of the stack (above any desktop application of
	  course)

     - implementation of ICE protocol and xsmp protocol. (lib/ice lib/sm)

     - eclipse now connect itself to the session manager according to the
       xsmp protocol. (see the cvs commit message for more infos)

     - fix forgotten added slot hint-p of motion-notify event.

     - fix bug with shaded windows and virtual screen switching.

     - move resize improvements:

       We now use the :pointer-potion-hint in the event-mask. The server
       is now free to send only one :motion-notify event, until either the
       key or button state changes, the pointer leaves the event window,
       or the client calls query-pointer or motion-events. 

       This allow us to be served only for event when we can deal with. As
       effect opaque move and resize are smoother.

         side effects: 
	    decoration time slot removed.
	    modify event handling of motion-notify

       find-corner modfication: It now looks for the cardinal point by
       dichotomy in the window split in 16 pieces. 

     - configure-window [ function ] added for ICCCM and EWMH complience.

     - support for :_NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW client message.

     - support for :_NET_WORKAREA (ewmh says we have to set it)
	implies :_net_wm_strut_partial :_net_wm_strut property notify
	handling to reflect changes in the net_workarea property and
	a call to update-workarea-property when changing the number of
	virtual screens.
	
     - a very little change in the define-theme syntax. Style parts are
       now defined in a list (such as the class slots for example). This
       allow to have the :title-bar-position :parts-to-redraw-on-focus
       potions to be effectively optional. Plus a :background option has
       been added. This will be useful to the one who wants to define a
       no-decoration style like but with colored border. See the
       documentation (for more).

     - Christian point out a bug/inconsitency with emacs and multiple
       frame. Changing frames with C-x 5-o was not raising frames. It is
       now fix.
       the fix consist in:
          - add :susbstructure-redirect in the decoration event mask.
	  - add event handling for configure-request on decoration.
	  - add event handling for map-request on decoration.
	
     - bug fix and code clean up and more hacking.
       - error handling at start up.
       - close-sm-connection (widget.lisp)
       - (event-process selection-notify null)
       - bug fix and typo in gestures.lisp
       - bug fix in ewmh implementation.
       - ...

O.10 => 0.11
