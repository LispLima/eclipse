     - focus management is ICCCM complient. (thanks to Matthias Clasen)
     - pointer freezing corrections.
     - unexpected events during resize corrected.
     - unexpected events during move partially corrected.
     
     - gnome extended wm spec implemented and support added.

     - a mouse click in an application now puts it on top.
     - users can now define their own keystrokes. (see the man section)

     - some bugs fix.
     - some functionalities added.
     - file splitting to reorganize the project a little:
     - wm.lisp and global.lisp had been splitted into:
	- widgets.lisp (base-widget, root, application, buttons, ...)
	- input.lisp (general event processing)
	- gestures.lisp (key-combo, cursor movement)
	- eclipse.lisp (Top level functions)
	- move-resize (moving and resizing master)
	- misc.lisp (...)
	- lib/clx-ext/clx-extensions.lisp
     - gnome-manager.lisp had been splitted into:
	- manager-commons.lisp
	- gnome-manager.lisp
	- netwm-manager.lisp
	- one directory added with one sub-directory: lib and lib/clx-ext
	- a new package clx-extensions in lib/clx-ext
	- some files had moved:
	  - image-reader.lisp into lib
	  - event.lisp ...... into lib/clx-ext
	  - cursor.lisp ..... ----------------
	  - cursordef.lisp .. ----------------
	  - keysysms.lisp ... ----------------
	  - keysymdef.lisp .. ----------------

     - commit Christian Lynbech patch:
       CMUCL seems to have tighten the handling of certain things so this
       patch will do three necessary things:

       - in system.lisp (compile-theme) remove path from :output-file name as
         this includes path specs from the input file.

       - in wm.lisp (menu-3-prcess) removes the &allow-other-keys which CMUCL
         18d chokes on (some previous versions seemed more lax, they also
	 accepted (lambda (&rest) ...) which 18d does not but you have gotten
	 rid of that).

      - in lib/image-reader.lisp (load-ppm) changes function to use two
        streams as there are many things you cannot do on a non-character
	string including calling `unread-char'.
	
0.04=>0.05

     - various bug fix. (with-state missing, undecore-application, some
       unhandle events during menu-3 loop, ...)
     - procede-decoration code is inside an unwind-protect.
     - support for focus-new-mapped-window
     - support for :_net_wm_state_maximized_{horz/vert},
       and :_net_wm_state_fullscreen.
     - fix typo parenthesis, and grid undraw in mouse stroke resize/move.
     - more netwm complience improvement (fullscreen, hidden, 
       icon-name, maximized)
     - Christian Lynbech patch for icon managment has been applied.
       "It provides an icon box, ie. a configurable place where icons are
        stacked. As part of this change, I have changed the default location
	of icons from (750,50) to (0,0). If the icon box overflows, icons will
	be created ayt (0,0). I have also decreased the default height from 60
	to 20 to minimize the space waste (if the application supplies an
	icon, it will of course take precedence).

	The patch allso adds different kinds of sorting options. Icons can be
	sorted by creation time (I have added a new slot in the `icon' class)
	or name or class (or whatever else you can think of).

	It still needs a few things, such as the possibility of disabling the
	icon box and other fill orders than :top-right (ie. filling from the
	top right corner of the box)."
     
     - Unrelated to the icon box thing, the patch also contains a set of
       application inspection function (see the end of "misc.lisp"), A
       disabling of the expression that removes the "Exit" entry in the root
       menu so that you can close Eclipse down and finally a new option,
       *close-display-p*, that regulates whether exiting Eclipse also kills
       the entire X session (if *close-display-p* is nil, Eclipse will just
       exit).
     
     - ICCCM complience and extended window manager specification complience.
       - bugs fix relative to extended wm spec (i.e.: we now should interact
         correctly with gnome 2.2)
       - added ICCCM session managment complience: we now use/react to the
         owning of the WM_S{screen number} selection. see ICCCM 2.8

0.05=>0.06

     - The package now exports almost every symbols. They are sorted in
       alphabetical order and type order (class, generic function,
       function, ...)

     - An application that does not support to be maximized in fullscreen
       don't have the _net_wm_state_fullscreentom present in its
       _net_wm_state property anymore.

     - lib/clx-patch.lisp: fixed bug found in input-focus.

     - few new methods:
       dispatch-repaint: new method for the repaint protocol.
       repaint: the main method of the repaint protocol.
       (draw-focused-decoration & draw-unfocused-decoration: removed.)

     - themes are now defined in their own packages.
       All theme are updated.

0.06=>0.07

     - shade is now implemented (wm.lisp).
       To {un}shade a window double click on title bar.

     - *double-click-speed* for user configuration.
       use it to customize the time you want for double click.
       Default value: 200 (timestamp unit of the X server)

     - added support for the xvidmode extension
       (lib/clx-ext/xvidmode.lisp).

     - added support for :net_wm_state_{below, above}

     - various changes in window stacking order manipulation.
       (see put-on-top, and put-on-bottom)
     
     - buttons are now able to display a pixmap that shows its state (e.g: 
       pressed or not).
	
     - added support for _net_active_window message

     - various  bug fix and improvements:

       - typo fix *wRAp-pointer-when-cycle* => *wARp-pointer-when-cycle*
                   full-screen-mode => fullscreen-mode

       - changing the focus now cares of the map state of the window it
	 is supose to gives the focus to. (Should avoid lots of match-error).
         Wrong nil timestamp has been fixed.

       - fullscreen-mode should now be correct: the spec say it would be
         better to undecore the window when in fullscreen. It does now.


       - maximize-window signature changes. It now expect an application 
	 instead of a decoration.  
	 => STROKES USING MAXIMIZE-WINDOW SHOULD BE UPDATED.

       - minor changes in update-edges-geometry, and move-resize.lisp.

       - virtual-screen.lisp re-implementation. It now use the X server
         data such the root window tree, and window property that hold the
	 desktop number instead of an internal substructure that has to be
	 updated each time you destroy, un/iconify, shade, unshade, etc.

       - fix incorect placement of the menu button when the title bar is
	 vertical.

       - fix handling of message of type :_WIN_WORKSPACE :_NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP.
       
       - fix the _net_active_window property handling for undecorated windows.

       - fix missplaced handling for message of type _net_close_window.

       - some code clean up (removed some unused code).

     - lots of documentations added almost every where.
